## Task
Your task is to control the lander to land on the landing pad smoothly without crashing.

## Action Space
There are four discrete actions available:

- 0: do nothing
- 1: fire left orientation engine
- 2: fire main engine
- 3: fire right orientation engine

## Observation Space
The state is an 8-dimensional vector: the coordinates of the lander in `x` & `y`, its linear velocities in `x` & `y`, its angle, its angular velocity, and two booleans that represent whether each leg is in contact with the ground or not.

## Starting State
The lander starts at the top center of the viewport with a random initial force applied to its center of mass.

## Episode Termination
The episode finishes if:
1. the lander crashes (the lander body gets in contact with the moon);
2. the lander gets outside of the viewport (x coordinate is greater than 1);
3. the lander is not awake. From the Box2D docs, a body which is not awake is a body which doesn’t move and doesn’t collide with any other body:
